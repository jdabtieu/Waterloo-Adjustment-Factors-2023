# Waterloo Adjustment Factors

<!--**A FIPPA request for the 2023 and 2024 adjustment factors (2023/24 and 2024/25 admission cycles) has been made. A response is expected by March 2025.**-->

This repository contains the adjustment factors from 2016-2024, used for the 2016/17-2024/25 admissions cycles. The adjustment factors are used for undergrad Engineering admissions at the University of Waterloo only.

## Where are the latest adjustment factors?
[AdjFactors2025.pdf](AdjFactors2025.pdf)

## Why is there no AdjFactors2024.pdf?
Because I didn't make a [FIPPA request](https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy/access-request) and nobody else who did was willing to share the data.

If you have this data and would like to share, feel free to make a pull request to add it to this repo or email me with it at `me [at] jonathanw.dev`
